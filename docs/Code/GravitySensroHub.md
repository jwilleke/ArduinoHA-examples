# GravitySensorHub

The `GravitySensorHub` class is a manager for a collection of sensor objects, each of which is presumably a different type of sensor used for measuring environmental values in various ways.

The `ISensor` interface, which you've shown in your latest excerpt, provides a common interface for these sensor objects. It declares three methods:

- `setup()`
- `update()`
- `getValue()`
Any class that implements this interface must provide definitions for these methods.

The `GravitySensorHub` class creates instances of these sensor classes and stores them in an array. This allows the `GravitySensorHub` to manage multiple sensors in a uniform way, by interacting with them through the `ISensor` interface.

For example, the `GravitySensorHub` could iterates over its array of `ISensor` pointers and call the `update()` method on each one to update all sensors. Or it could call `getValue()` on each sensor to collect a set of readings.

In summary, the `GravitySensorHub` class serves as a central point for managing multiple related sensors, allowing for uniform interaction with different types of sensors.
