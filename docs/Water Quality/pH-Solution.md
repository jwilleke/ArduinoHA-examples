# pH UP and pH Down


Stabilize your nutrient pH with General HydroponicsÂ® pH Up and pH Down. pH is important because it affects availability and absorption of several of the 16 atomic elements needed for plant growth. 

Maximum absorption of these elements is found at pH readings 5.5 to 6.5. 

When pH falls below this range many of the macroelements (NPK) have less availability, and absorption of the micronutrients can reach toxic levels. 

## pH Up

pH Up is a base solution formulated with potassium hydroxide and potassium carbonate. Add a little at a time when your nutrient pH is too low in order to raise it to the proper level. 
Always start out with one milliliter of pH Up per gallon. (5 ml for 5 gallons of circulating water)

## pH Down

pH Down is an acid formulation that uses phosphoric acid to lower the pH. Always start out with one milliliter of pH Up/Down per gallon. Wait 15 To 30 minutes, and test your water again. You will usually only need 1 to 2 ml of pH Up/Down per gallon of water. You may need additional pH Up/Down if you have hard water.
