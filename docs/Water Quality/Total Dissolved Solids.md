# Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)

Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)  is the total amount of inorganic and organic substances dissolved in water or other liquids. These dissolved substances can include minerals, salts, metals, etc.

TDS is typically measured in parts per million (ppm) and is an important parameter for assessing water quality.

## Water Quality Indicator

A higher TDS reading indicates a higher concentration of dissolved salts and minerals, while a lower TDS reading indicates a lower concentration.

If the raw water TDS is high it can lead to nutrient locking, which can result in poor growth and nutrient deficiencies in plants. Also, the higher the TDS, the higher the chances of the presence of harmful elements or chemicals. So it is advisable to use RO water with a lesser TDS for more control over the nutrition you provide for your plants. It is advisable to use water with a TDS of less than 250 ppm. The lower the better.

Nutrient solutions for hydroponically grown cannabis should be around

- 500-600 ppm for young clones and seedlings
- 800-900 ppm for vegetating plants
- 1000-1100 ppm for flowering.
- Tap water
  - 0 - 300 ppm EXCLENT - Safe
  - 301 - 600 ppm GOOD - Safe
  - 601 - 900 ppm FAIR - Safe
  - 901 - 1,200 ppm POOR - Some people may have issue
