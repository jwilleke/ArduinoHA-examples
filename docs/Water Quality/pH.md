One of the most important indicators for water quality is its pH level. The pH scale runs from 0 to 14 and measures the acid or base quality of water. A pH of 7 is neutral, while a reading below 7 is acidic, and one above 7 is alkaline or basic.

Water quality depends on proper pH levels. In acidic water, for example, toxic heavy metals dissolve easily and are more harmful to living things. The pH level also affects the availability of essential plant nutrients, with many nutrients being less available at a pH above 7.

## Why pH is Important in Hydroponic Systems

The right pH level is crucial because it affects nutrient availability for your growing plants. A pH level that is too high or alkaline can prevent nutrient uptake and lead to deficiencies. Iron deficiency causes pale or yellow leaves in young plants, while leaf cupping and tip burn are telltale signs of calcium deficiency. Calcium can also form salts that leave white deposits or scale on reservoir walls and equipment.

Hydroponically grown plants need different pH levels than plants grown in soil. Without soil, plants do not benefit from microorganisms, organic matter, and interactions between water and minerals that regulate pH levels. The hydroponic gardener must constantly monitor and adjust pH levels. Make sure that you do not apply pH recommendations for soil-grown plants to hydroponically grown plants.

## Typical pH Ranges for Crops

With some exceptions, the optimal pH range for hydroponically grown crops is generally between 5.5 and 6. Many fruits and vegetables, such as melons, apples, beans, squash, and tomatoes prefer that range. Blueberries, on the other hand, need a lower, more acidic pH between 4.0 and 5.0. It’s a good idea to use separate nutrient reservoirs for plants with similar pH ranges.

Some hydroponic crops have a wide optimal pH range. Pumpkin, for example, will thrive in a pH between 5.5 and 7.5. Crops that require alkaline conditions include kale, onions, and peas, which prefer pH levels between 6.0 and 7. Mint plants tip the scale at an optimal pH range of 7.0 to 8.0.

## Typical pH Ranges for Nutrient Systems

Hydroponic nutrient products typically start with pH levels between 5.5 and 6.0, the optimal level for most crops. The pH range, however, depends on the specific formulation. For example, ammonium nitrate has a more acidifying effect than nitrate and will cause a drop in pH. Calcium salts, on the other hand, cause a rise in pH, resulting in a more alkaline solution.

Specific nutrients require certain pH levels for plant uptake. The wrong pH level can result in too little or too much of certain nutrients. For example, when the pH level drops below 5.0, plants can develop magnesium and calcium deficiencies or copper and iron toxicity. A pH level above 6 or 6.5, however, can cause iron deficiency.

## Why pH Levels Change in Hydroponics Systems

Several factors can cause pH levels to change in hydroponic systems. When the amount of the nutrient solution drops below one gallon, the solution becomes more concentrated as plants absorb the nutrients. This results in widely fluctuating pH levels. It is, therefore, important to monitor nutrient solution levels, keep the reservoir full, and regularly test the pH in the reservoir.

Both inorganic and organic matter can affect pH levels in hydroponics systems. For example, gravel and other inorganic growing media act as a buffer and cause pH levels to rise in media-based systems. In a natural environment, soil acts as a buffer in a similar way. To get an accurate pH reading in a media-based system, test the pH of the reservoir solution as well as the solution (leachate) that drains from the beds or bags that hold the plants.

Algae and bacteria are the main types of organic matter that affect pH levels. If pH levels rise in the morning and drop later in the day, algae may be the culprit. As algae consume acidic carbon dioxide during the day, pH levels rise and then fall by evening. On the other hand, bacteria from root disease can cause a dramatic drop in pH levels. As diseased roots decompose, bacteria will release acids into the hydroponic solution.

## How to Maintain the Right pH Levels

The first step in maintaining the right pH levels is testing. A variety of testing supplies are available. Test strips and liquid test kits are the least expensive and are available at pool supply stores and garden centers. Digital pH meters are more accurate and offer repeatable results. You should test frequently with whatever hydroponic testing instruments you choose, even daily if you have recently adjusted nutrient levels or have little experience with hydroponics.

If you use a recirculating system, adjust the pH level according to test results from the supply reservoir. In a media-based system, however, the pH changes as the nutrient solution travels from the supply reservoir and out through the grow base. Adjust pH levels based on the pH of the leachate that drains from the grow beds.

Commercially prepared “pH up” and “pH down” products are available to maintain the right pH levels. You can purchase these products in dry or liquid form and use them according to label instructions. Make sure you use products that are formulated for hydroponic systems. For small systems or short-term results, you can add weak acids such as vinegar or citric acid.

Automatic pH controllers cost more than pH up or pH down products but they keep the pH at consistent levels. This option works best in recirculating systems to prevent pH fluctuations that occur as plants feed.

If your water is hard, the buffering effect of the high mineral levels will cause high pH levels. A reverse osmosis system is an efficient and relatively affordable method for reducing water hardness.

## pH and Drinking Water

There is no legally enforceable standard for drinking water pH levels because pH is considered an aesthetic water quality. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends a pH between 6.5 and 8.5 for drinking water. Since metals dissolve readily in acidic water, dissolved metals may be present in drinking water with a low pH level. Metals such as iron, manganese, copper, and lead can leach into drinking water from pipes or the local aquifer.

In acidic water, iron causes a metallic taste as well as reddish stains on clothing and plumbing, while other metals such as lead are toxic. Alkaline or “hard” water contains excess calcium and other minerals that cause the familiar scaly deposits on cookware and a bitter taste in coffee

## pH and Groundwater

Groundwater flows through rocks and soil that can affect the water’s pH level. For example, contact with sandstone results in a nearly neutral pH between 6.5 and 7.5. Limestone, on the other hand, can result in an alkaline pH of 8.5.

Soils contain minerals and other substances that affect groundwater pH. Decaying organic matter in soils causes pH levels in groundwater to drop as low as 4.0. That pH level is well below the recommended 6.5 to 7.5 pH for drinking water.

Human-induced pollution affects groundwater pH as well. For example, runoff from shale and coal mining contains iron sulfide, which can result in pH readings as low as 2.

## pH and Streams and Lakes

The pH level in a lake or stream is crucial for the survival of fish and aquatic plants. Freshwater lakes and streams typically have pH levels between 6.0 and 8.0. Deeper lakes usually have a higher pH near the surface.

Aquatic organisms are sensitive to pH changes. For example, the optimal pH level for fish ranges from 6.5 to 9.0. At levels outside this range, fish become susceptible to poisoning from toxic chemicals. Changes in pH can also cause an overload of available plant nutrients, resulting in excessive plant growth and depleted oxygen levels for fish. This condition, known eutrophication, threatens the survival of plant and animal life in the water.

## Water Testing With a pH Meter

Scientists use a pH meter to measure pH levels in the water. The water testing takes place on-site using a relatively small, portable meter or in a lab using a larger benchtop meter. The benchtop meter has a cup that holds the water sample and a glass probe with two specialized electrodes. The pH electrode measures the acidity of the water sample, while the reference electrode is immersed in a liquid with a fixed acidity. After the reading from the pH electrode is compared with the reading from the reference electrode, the meter converts the voltage to a pH level.

A pH meter provides a much more accurate reading than a test strip kit and prevents the mess associated with having to use droppers. Calibration before testing water samples ensures that the pH meter will provide accurate readings and test results.

## Importance of pH in Water

Water quality is crucial for all living things, as well as for agriculture and recreation. Optimal pH levels are an essential factor in maintaining water quality and healthy ecosystems. Accurate pH testing helps keep drinking water and groundwater safe and helps protect aquatic plants and animals.
