# Electoircal Conductivity (EC Sensor)

Conductivity measures water’s ability to conduct electricity due to the presence or absence of certain ions.

While pure water conducts electricity poorly, water that has certain chemicals or elements in it, and at varying amounts—including sodium, magnesium, calcium, and chloride—is a better conductor of electricity.

Generally speaking, as water salinity increases, conductivity increases alongside it. Water that’s warmer also tends to have more conductivity.

## hydroponics and Electoircal Conductivity

Using an EC meter is an essential practice in hydroponics to monitor and adjust nutrient concentrations in the nutrient solution, ensuring that your plants receive the correct amount of essential nutrients for healthy growth and optimal yields.

Nutrients are applied in the form of salts, and when these salts dissolve into water they break down into ions. For example, NaCl breaks down into Na+ and Cl– ions. These ions conduct electricity due to their positive and negative ions. Thus, the conductivity of the solution increases with added ions. So EC is a good measure of amount of salts in the solution. A higher EC means higher salt concentration, while a lower EC means a lower salt concentration.

Excessively high levels of nutrients induce osmotic stress, ion toxicity and nutrient imbalance, while excessively low values are mostly accompanied by nutrient deficiencies and decreasing plant growth. In soilless culture, total salt concentration of a nutrient solution is the most important characteristic. Conductivity Factor (CF) is a measure of the electrical conductivity of a nutrient solution read in mS/cm (millisemen per centimeter) and sometimes given as μs/cm, which can be multiplied by 1,000 to convert to mS/cm

## Why does water conductivity need to be measured?

In lab settings, water conductivity needs to be measured because researchers and scientists need to know the exact composition of the water they’re experimenting with in order to get accurate, repeatable results. This is why purified water is so common in the pharmaceutical, semiconductor, and solar industries.

Water conductivity, however, has major implications on several other industries, too.

For example, in the food and beverage industry, water conductivity needs to be measured to ensure high-quality end products are produced efficiently—thereby increasing profitability and minimizing risks.

Aquaculture and aquarium businesses also need to pay close attention to water conductivity. Freshwater fish and saltwater fish, for example, may need different levels of water conductivity to survive. By monitoring conductivity levels, aquarium and aquaculture companies get insight into whether the water in their tanks is changing. With that information on hand, they can take proactive steps to bring the water back to equilibrium.

Water conductivity plays an important role in ensuring water quality.

## TEMPERATURE AND CONDUCTIVITY

Conductivity measurements vary with temperature, if the temperature increases so too does the conductivity measurement. This causes problems when performing monitoring as the readings fluctuate with both actual changes and temperature related changes.

In order allow comparison of conductivity results and remove the variation by temperature, the concept of a reference temperature was introduced. Generally, the reference temperature used is 25 Degrees Celsius (C), but sometimes the reference temperature of 20 degrees C is used.

All Aquaread conductivity sensors come pre-set to compensate at 25 degrees meaning you will not see any variation in your readings should the temperature of the water change during an event like rainfall. If this does not suit your application however, you are free to change this in the software.
