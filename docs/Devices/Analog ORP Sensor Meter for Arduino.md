# Analog ORP Sensor Meter for Arduino

[Gravity: Analog ORP Sensor Meter for Arduino SKU:SEN0165](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1071.html)

## Introduction

In the ever-increasing need and awareness for health and safety, water has become a focus point for proper disinfection treatment as aftereffects of industrialization can become a danger for contamination of water via direct contact. Water is a critical control point of contact where proper treatment can greatly reduce these microbes, thereby reducing the chances of illness and pollution.  

While traditional ORP meters are hard to get or use, this Analog ORP Meter is a highly compact ORP monitoring system that fits into your Arduino. This design configuration allows the user to accurately monitor ORP without having to add any additional circuitry or components to your design. Communication with the Analog ORP Meter is done using only simple wiring and programming. You may also check Liquid Sensor Selection Guide to get better familiar with our liquid sensor series.

ORP (Oxidation-Reduction Potential) is a measure of the ability of oxidation and reduction of the aqueous solution, characterization of oxidizing or reducing the relative degree. Unlike a pH measurement that follows a logarithmic curve and therefore requires more calibration adjustments, ORP follows a linear relationship and does not need instrument adjustment as much as it needs electrode maintenance. ORP has proven to be a reliable method of measuring water quality and provides the operator with a single value of measurement regardless of which product, commodity, operation, treatment, or sanitizer is used, and regardless of varying field conditions or methods by which chemical is applied.  

## Warnings

The bottle cap of the probe contains protective liquid (3.3mol/L KCL). Even if the bottle cap is screwed tightly, some protective liquid may still leak around the bottle cap, forming white crystals. But as long as there is still protective liquid in the bottle cap, it will not affect the life and accuracy of the probe. So please use it with confidence. It is recommended that the white crystals be poured back into the protective liquid in the bottle cap.

When the ORP probe is connected to the ORP meter board, please do not press the calibration button Or the ORP probe may be damaged!

## Tips

This product does not contain a temperature sensor. In order to ensure the measurement accuracy, it is strongly recommended to add a temperature sensor to measure the temperature and achieve automatic temperature compensation. [DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor](/docs/Devices/Waterproof%20DS18B20%20Temperature%20Sensor%20Kit.md) can be used.
