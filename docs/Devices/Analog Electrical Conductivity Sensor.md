# Analog Electrical Conductivity Sensor

## Overview

DFRobot Gravity: analog electrical conductivity sensor/meter(K=10) is particularly used to measure the high electrical conductivity liquid, such as seawater, concentrated brine, etc. The measurement range is up to 100ms/cm. This product is suitable for the water quality application of mariculture, for example, marine fisheries, marine aquariums.

Analog Electrical Conductivity Sensor supports 3~5v wide voltage input and is compatible with 5V and 3.3V main control boards, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi. The excitation source adopts an AC signal, which effectively reduces the polarization effect, improves the precision, and prolongs the life of the probe; The software library uses a single-point calibration method, and can automatically identify a standard buffer solution, so simple and convenient.

With this product, main control board (such as Arduino), and the software library, you can quickly build an electrical conductivity meter, plug, and play, no soldering required, which provides a set of plug-and-play conductivity measurement solutions for makers.

DFRobot provides a variety of water quality sensor products, uniform size, and interface, not only meet the needs of various water quality testing but also suitable for the DIY of multi-parameter water quality tester.

## Tips

This product does not contain a temperature sensor. In order to ensure the measurement accuracy, it is strongly recommended to add a temperature sensor to measure the temperature and achieve automatic temperature compensation. [DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor](/docs/Devices/Waterproof%20DS18B20%20Temperature%20Sensor%20Kit.md) can be used.

## Warnings

The probe is a laboratory-grade probe. Do not immerse in liquid for a long time. Otherwise, this will shorten the life of the probe.

Platinum black layer is attached to the surface of the sheet metal in the probe. It should avoid any object touching it. It can only be washed with distilled water, otherwise, the platinum black layer will be damaged, resulting in an inaccurate measurement.
