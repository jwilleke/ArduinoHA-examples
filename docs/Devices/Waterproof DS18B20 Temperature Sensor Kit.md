# Waterproof DS18B20 Temperature Sensor Kit

[Gravity: Waterproof DS18B20 Temperature Sensor Kit SKU:KIT0021 Brand:DFRobot](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1354.html)

Used for our [Grow System](https://github.com/users/jwilleke/projects/2) within the [Nutrient-Tank](https://github.com/jwilleke/Nutrient-Tank)

## INTRODUCTION

This waterproof temperature sensor kit use DS18B20 probe AS. It contains a probe with a resistor module. So it is easy to connect on the Arduino board.

The DS18B20 temperature sensor provides 9 to 12-bit (configurable) temperature readings over a [1-Wire](/docs/1-Wire%20Protocol.md) interface so that only one wire (and ground) needs to be connected from a central microprocessor. Compatible with 3.0-5.5V systems.

If you want to make a simple water purifier, we recommend buying together with Gravity: Analog TDS Sensor/Meter for Arduino.
