# Gravity: Analog Signal Isolator

We used the [Gravity: Analog Signal Isolator SKU:DFR0504](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1621.html)

Used for our [Grow System](https://github.com/users/jwilleke/projects/2) within the [Nutrient-Tank](https://github.com/jwilleke/Nutrient-Tank)

## INTRODUCTION

In many cases, electrical isolation is required to ensure the reliable operation of the sensors. Some sensors, such as **pH sensors** and **EC conductivity sensors**, will interfere with each other and do not measure properly in the same container when they connect to the same power. To ensure stable and reliable operation of the sensors with no interference, it is necessary to isolate the signal and the power.

Gravity: Analog Signal Isolator is efficient in preventing the electrical interference between sensors. This module has an onboard 5V isolation power which could directly supply to the sensor. Therefore, you do not need to prepare the external power, such an easy and practical! The connector of wires are special designed for DFRobot 3Pin analog sensor, plug and play, no need for soldering. The analog signal transmission ratio is 1:1, which contributes to a very small impact on output signals of sensors when this module connect into the circuit. Furthermore, you do not need to change the code of the mainboard.

This analog signal isolator is applicable to prevent interferences between sensors, such as a multi-parameter water quality monitoring system that need to prevent interferences between water sensors.
