# Chemical Stirrers

As comercial Chemical Stirrers cost ~ $100.00 each an we wanted to have 4 of them the cost was prohibitive.

Further, we also wanted to autmate when the the Chemical Stirrers were operated.

Several finds on Youtube looked promising by using 120 mm fans with magnets attached to them.

## Attempt One

Bought set of 5 (five) fans Okinos, 67CFM, 1500RPM, 4Pin PWM, Hurricane Series, 120mm Case Fan 5 Packs, High Airflow $16.99
We purchased some small 12mm x3 mm round flat magnets. These are polarized to-to-bottom (Diametric) so if we put one up and one down, we should be able to make it work.
These were difficult, at least for me to get mounted and did not appear to be strong enough to magnetically pull the magnetic "pills" when placed in a container.

## Attempt two

Bought longer PTFE Magnetic Stirrer Mixer Stir Bar (8 Pieces, 35 mm/ 1.38 Inch) $9.24.
Seemed to help, but still not enough.

## Attempt three

Bought second set of fans Okinos, 67CFM, 1500RPM, 4Pin PWM, Hurricane Series, 120mm Case Fan 5 Packs, High Airflow $16.99
Bought flat bar magnets 40x10x5 mm,Pack of 24. these were the correct size but the flat bar magnets are polorized on the top and bottom and not end-to-end (Diametric)

## Attempt four

Had two Cylinder magnets approx 25.4mm x 6mm from door contact switches. These are axial Magnetization Direction.  Seem to work but would be better if Neodymium.

Decided we needed axial Cylinder Neodymium Permanent Rare Earth Circular Magnets 35mm x 6 mm.

Still appears that the container for the fluids need to be very flat and I could only get stirrer action to work if the fan speed was 5 V vs 12 V AND a flat bottom container.
