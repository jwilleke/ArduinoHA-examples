## Product Description

### Overview

The SGP40 VOC Sensor is a digital VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) sensor module which incorporates SGP40, designed for air quality monitoring. It can be used to measure fire coal, natural gas emissions, cigarette/cooking smoke, and emissions from constructing activity, decoration material, furnitures, home appliances, then generate digital signals for triggering air treatment devices. The SGP40 VOC Sensor is small in size for easy integration into air treatment devices and air quality monitors, definitely an ideal choice for learning air quality monitoring.
