# Qwiic connector

A Qwiic connector is a specific type of 4-pin JST connector used in a prototyping ecosystem that makes working with [I2C](/docs/ardrunio-basics/I2C.md) devices faster and easier. Here's a breakdown:

## Function

It simplifies connecting development boards like Arduinos and Raspberry Pis to various sensors, actuators, shields, and other I2C components.
These components are also designed with Qwiic connectors, forming a plug-and-play system.

## Benefits

No soldering: Say goodbye to messy and error-prone soldering! Qwiic cables simply plug into the connectors, saving time and reducing frustration.
Polarized connections: Unlike standard JST connectors, Qwiic connectors are keyed, preventing incorrect wiring of the SDA and SCL lines. This means less troubleshooting and more successful projects.
Daisy chaining: Many Qwiic boards have multiple connectors, allowing you to chain several devices together on the same [I2C](/docs/ardrunio-basics/I2C.md) bus. This expands your project possibilities and simplifies wiring.
Overall, Qwiic makes prototyping with [I2C](/docs/ardrunio-basics/I2C.md) devices enjoyable and accessible. It's popular among hobbyists, educators, and professionals alike.
