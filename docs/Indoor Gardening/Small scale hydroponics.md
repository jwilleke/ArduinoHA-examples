# Small scale hydroponics

## Hydroponic Systems

Hydroponic Systems can be separated into two broad classifications and seven others.

[Hydroponics Definition & How It Works](https://youtu.be/tZ-ZhXk6V70?si=Ab_HcszlXH3n76T4)  - Kratky, NFT and others explained

### Air and Water Seperated

- Nutrient Film Technique
- Kratky Method (1.8 due to HIGH Maintenance)
- Eb and Flow

### Air and Water Combined

- Drip (3.5)
- Wicking
  - Sub-irrigated planter
  - Sponge
- Aeroponics (3.5)
  - Low pressure
  - High Pressure
  - Ultrasonic Mist
- Water Culture
  - Deep Water (3.3)
  - Floating Systems
  - Hybrid Systems
- Soil - as a control method (3.0)

### Deep Water Culture

The simplest hydroponic systems to use at home fall into a category of hydroponics called “Deep Water Culture.”
Plants are suspended above a tank of water and the roots hang into the container where they absorb water and nutrients.
This is the most common type of hydroponic system for small-scale growers such as people growing for their own use and school demonstration gardens.
It is also the least expensive and easiest to maintain and expand.

### Dutch Bucket

Dutch Bucket is probably the most popular type used for hydroponic systems. Depending on the implementation the term Dutch Bucket is either a:
Drain to Waste system where overflow water is discarded
Recirculating system where water is returned to the nutrient tank reservoir (most common indoors)
Less prone to root rot
Dutch Bucket is an Eb and Flow type system that relies on a nutrient tank reservoir with an air pump with a nutrient pump.
Dutch Bucket is often used for larger plants like tomatoes or ???

### Nutrient film

In a nutrient film system, plants are usually grown in channels or troughs. The idea is similar to deep water culture in that there is a constant stream of water available to the roots. The water is constantly moving and tends to be quite shallow.

- This type of system uses a reservoir for water and nutrients (such as a large plastic drum) and the water is pulled into the channels, usually with tubing and a pump.
- The channels are angled downwards to allow for water flow. When the water reaches the end it is recirculated to the reservoir.
- These can be purchased as premade units, or homemade with recycled gutters.
- This is an efficient system for larger-scale operations because it allows you to manage the water and nutrient solution from one central location.

## Water Quality in Hydroponics

Water quality in hydroponics is one of the most important aspects of any system. The basic principle that separates hydroponics from other forms of agriculture is that plants are grown in water, without soil. Plants grown hydroponically cannot take in nutrients from soil. As a result, water is the delivery guy for all the nutrients plants need. Growing media does help retain some nutrients, but water is what gets them there in the first place. Unfortunately, not any water delivers nutrients with the same efficiency. Poor water quality can kill plants and make it impossible for nutrient uptake in plants.

The main items with hydroponic water include:

- pH too high or low
- Not enough oxygen
- Nutrient solution too hot or cold
- Low or high EC
- Contaminants
- Stagnant, old water
- Temperature
- Carbon dioxide (CO2)
- Humidity

Testing EC, pH, and TDS are the most common ways to measure hydroponic water. For home or hobby growers, these are usually all that is needed. For serious growers and commercial operations, more advanced monitoring comes into play. 

So, how can you measure hydroponic water quality? Take a look at some of these ways:

### pH

pH, or potential hydrogen, measures the acidity or alkalinity of the medium. The easiest, and most inexpensive (at least, initially) way of measuring pH is with test strips. You dip the test strip into the water for a few seconds. Then, after 30 seconds or so, the strip changes color. The color of the strip corresponds to a color on a pH chart, which comes with the test strips. Whichever color the strip matches on the chart gives you an idea of the pH in your water. Digital pH meters cost more upfront, but provide more reliable results, and can be reused for years.
Each crop is an individual with its own set of pH preferences. Lettuce, for example, 
Lettuce thrives at a pH between 6.0 and 7.0
tomatoes do best from 5.5 to 6.5.

#### pH Adjustments

For raising pH, consider solutions like Plagron pH Up or Terra Aquatica pH Up. They often contain potassium hydroxide or calcium carbonate.
For lowering pH, Terra Aquatica pH Down or Plagron pH Down that using phosphoric or nitric acid are common choices.

### EC

EC, or electrical conductivity, measures the density of salts in hydroponic water. Plants have a ‘target’ EC, which tells you how much nutrients you need in your solution. If EC falls, it means you need to add more nutrients. The best way to measure EC is with a digital meter. EC results are most commonly shown as mS/cm, or milli Siemens per centimeter.

### TDS

TDS, or Total Dissolved Solids, measures the items within a solution, much like EC does. The difference is that EC measures ions that release when salts dissolve in water. TDS measures any solid dissolved within a liquid. Where EC shows measurements in mS/cm, TDS shows measurements in PPM, or parts per million. TDS may also be measured using a digital meter.

### CO2

CO2 is a crucial element to a good harvest. Plants need to be able to take in enough CO2 to grow properly. Carbon dioxide (CO2) helps crops generate larger harvests. However, it also speeds up the growth process, which reduces the time until you can harvest. Many hydroponic systems make use of CO2 enrichment systems. If you are adding CO2, it is important to monitor the concentration.

### Humidity

The amount of humidity in a greenhouse or grow area needs to be monitored and controlled. Too much humidity, and plants will not be able to transpire.
Transpiration is the process wherein plants release moisture and oxygen. If they cannot transpire, they eventually stop taking in nutrient solution. That is because the plants already have too much moisture they cannot get rid of. Of course, too high humidity can also invite any number of fungi and pathogens. If humidity is too low, plants dry out and may even get scorched. Hygrometers are the typical tool used to measure humidity. In greenhouses with monitoring systems, sensors designed to measure humidity often have a similar name.

### Hydroponic water temperature

Root zones need certain temperatures to take in nutrients and stay healthy. In hydroponics, soil does not act as an insulator. Which means the temperature of the nutrient solution is important. Ideally, the nutrient solution should be between 60 and 75 degrees. Considering the lights and heat of your grow room, you may need to cool or warm your nutrient solution.
Most people quickly realize that nutrient solution getting hot (from warm lights) is more to contend with than cold solution. While you can buy a special device, called a ‘chiller’, for nutrient solution, you can use other, more affordable solutions. Try keeping your reservoir farther from your plants and insulate it. Both of these can make a big difference, especially when you increase ventilation.
If you struggle with cold nutrient solution, a heater is more affordable than a chiller. That said, you can also place your reservoir a little closer to your plants (if you have warm lights). Be careful though, because too much heat is not good either.

### How often do you change water in a hydroponic system?

For beginners, hydroponic water changes can seem confusing. Once you learn the basics, it’s really just part of a routine. Proper water changes are essential to keeping healthy hydroponic plants, and a healthy hydroponic garden. Keep your water clean, maintain stable pH and EC, and you’re on the right track.
Several factors affect the frequency of water changes. But to simplify it, most hydroponic water needs to be switched out every two weeks to every three weeks. Typically, hydroponic systems need water added everyday too.
The size, type, and ambient environment of your hydroponic system also determine how often you need to change your hydroponic water, or nutrient solution.
Take care, because water changes are more than just throwing a gallon or two in your reservoir every few days.
