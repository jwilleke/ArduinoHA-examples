## Lighting Terms

### PAR (Parabolic Aluminized Reflector)

PAR is a factor of Bulb design as you see on most bulbs stands for "Parabolic Aluminized Reflector," indicating a specific bulb design that focuses light into a beam. Bulbs commonly come in sizes like PAR16 (2" diameter), PAR20 (2.5" diameter), PAR30 (3.75" diameter), and PAR38 (4.75" diameter).

PAR 38 bulb has a diameter of 38/8 inches, which is 4.75 inches. PAR refers to the widest diameter of the bulb reflestor (not the BULB) in eighths of an inch.

### PAR (Photosynthetic Active Radiation)

Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is the specific range of light wavelengths, from 400 to 700 nanometers, that plants use for photosynthesis. This range corresponds to the visible light spectrum, which is why light intensity is often an important factor in plant growth.

Plants absorb photons, or light particles, at these wavelengths and use the energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (sugar) and oxygen. This process, photosynthesis, is essential for plant life and is the foundation of most ecosystems on Earth.

### Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD)

Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density is a common term used interchangeably with PAR measurement. PPFD essentially means the same thing - the number of photons in the PAR range hitting a specific area per second. So, PAR meters often provide readings in PPFD units (µmol/m²/s).

### Lumens

Lumens measures the perceived brightness of light for the human eye. It considers the entire visible spectrum but emphasizes wavelengths we see most clearly (greens, yellows). Lumens don't directly translate to plant growth because they don't account for the specific wavelengths plants need. It's measured in lumens (lm).

### E26

E26 is the technical designation according to the international standard. The "E" stands for Edison screw (named after the inventor) and "26" refers to the diameter of the screw base in millimeters (around 26mm).

E26 is also called the "Medium screw base" is a general term describing the threading mechanism.
